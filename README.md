# python-self-learning-map
Step by step projects for learning python. I have assumed that I have no prior knowledge of coding in this repository.

## Hello World (helloworld.py)
    Classic "Hello World!" code. Just to have it here as a tradition. I told you I was assuming that I have no prior knowledge of coding lol

## Hello World on Window (hellowindow.py)
    A little updated version of the classic "Hello World" code. We basically get to see how to import a library and how to work with GUI.

## Age Calculation (age.py)
    Asks how old the user is and add 100 to the given number. This time we get to see how to interact with user via terminal.

## Random Password Generator (randompass.py)
    This code will create a random password for users. At this point I am just trying stuff by myself since I knew what to do with previous ones. So, from now on this might not be the most efficient way to do it.
